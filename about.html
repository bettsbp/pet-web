    <h1>About Gio and Brutus</h1>
    <h2>Brutus:</h2>
    <p>Brutus is a four legged dog. He has a horn on the front of his face, much like a unicorn. He is a special, unicorn-like dog. He eats grass, carpet, and insects. Brutus spends all his free time screaming at pedestrians. In Brutus' mind, screaming is both barking and howling. To humans, it is terrifying.</p>
    <p>Like most other dogs, Brutus loves to roll around in the backyard and turn a sickly shade of green. Unfortunately, unlike most other dogs, Brutus weighs 45 kilograms. This means that this little guy will destroy small buildings, small humans, and possibly other animals during his quaking.</p>
    <h2>Gio:</h2>
    <p>Gio is a four legged dog. He has a very long neck, and uses it to eat leaves from tall trees. He is an herbivore. He can also run very fast and swing his neck violently.</p>
